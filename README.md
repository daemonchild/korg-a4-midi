MIDI Utilities for Korg A4 Guitar Effects Processor

## TLDR;

This is a set of Python utilities for management of the patches on a Korg A4 guitar effects processor.

## Background

I bought my Korg A4 new in 1992 or 1993 IIRC. I finally decided to start playing the MIDI patches and found that software is somewhat limited.

Not really a surprise for a 25+ year old piece of electronics. There are commercial tools available, but they are very expensive, for example:

For example MidiQuest 12 looks amazing, but is way more than I need.

I wanted a set of utilities to allow management of MIDI data patches to and from the Korg A4.
I also wanted to be able to edit the settings on the computer in a quicker layout than on the A4 itself.
